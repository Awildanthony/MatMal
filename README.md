# CS 263 Final Project: Syscall-based Malware Detection using ML
This README is in progress

This repository contains a behavior-driven malware detection and classification system that captures fine-grained behavioral patterns of malware in a containerized environment. The system enables attribution of observed behaviors to specific malware families and variants through dynamic analysis of malicious binaries and subsequent production of their behavioral fingerprints.
