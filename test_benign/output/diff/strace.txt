Compare files line by line and output the differences between them.
This implementation supports unified diffs only.

	-a	Treat all files as text
	-b	Ignore changes in the amount of whitespace
	-B	Ignore changes whose lines are all blank
	-d	Try hard to find a smaller set of changes
	-i	Ignore case differences
	-L	Use LABEL instead of the filename in the unified header
	-N	Treat absent files as empty
	-q	Output only whether files differ
	-r	Recurse
	-S	Start with FILE when comparing directories
	-T	Make tabs line up by prefixing a tab when necessary
	-s	Report when two files are the same
	-t	Expand tabs to spaces in output
	-U	Output LINES lines of context
	-w	Ignore all whitespace) = 751 <0.000027>
